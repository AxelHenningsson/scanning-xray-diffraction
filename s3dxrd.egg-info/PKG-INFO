Description: Welcome to the s3dxrd project
        ===============================
        
        This is a scientific code originally developed to adress scanning-3dxrd
        strain measurements of polycrystalline materials.
        
        Intragranular strain is computed based on a series of line integral measurmenets. The regression procedure involves the use of a Gaussian 
        Proccess which is a statistical model that uses spatial correlation assumptions to find good fits to data. The resulting strain field is 
        guaranteed to be in local static equlibrium by imposing a prior constraint on the solution function sapace.
        
        If you want to use this code, it is strongly recomended that you have a look at the
        underlying `publication`_:
